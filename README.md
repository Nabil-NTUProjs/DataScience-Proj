Source Data: Dataset from: MsSmartyPants. (2021, June 30). Water quality. Kaggle. Retrieved February 3, 2022, from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/water-quality

Data Preparation and EDA:
We prepare the Data by eliminating NULL values and downsample the size of the data due the large imbalance between safe and unsafe data, which can result in an overtraining in either of the data and undertraining in the other.
