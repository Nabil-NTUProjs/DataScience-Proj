## Background:
Access to safe drinking water is important so that there is no health issues that arises from drinking contaminated water. Globally, 772 million people still lack basic access to clean water.There continues to be an investment in developing proper drinking water at a global level. However, there can be many factors that affect the condition of the water. Water samples are regularly collected from reservoirs and waterworks to ensure water supply is clean and safe for everyone. With so many water sources around the world, a lot of resources are spent on testing.

## Please view the codes in this order:
1. Data Extraction And Data Preparation (EDA: https://github.com/Note06/DataScience-Proj/blob/main/1015-Proj%20EDA.ipynb)/(Correlation: https://github.com/Note06/DataScience-Proj/blob/main/1015-Proj%20EDA%2BCorrelation.ipynb)
2. Using Machine Learning to get feature importance (Random forest: https://github.com/Note06/DataScience-Proj/blob/main/1015-Proj%20EDA%2BRandom%20Forest.ipynb)/ (Neural Network: https://github.com/Note06/DataScience-Proj/blob/main/1015-Proj%20EDA%20%2B%20Neural%20Network.ipynb)
3. We then use the data identified from EDA, Correlation, Random Forest and Neural Network ,and apply it to different prediction models. (EDA: https://github.com/Note06/DataScience-Proj/blob/main/Feature%20Importance(EDA).ipynb)/ (Correlation: https://github.com/Note06/DataScience-Proj/blob/main/Feature%20Importance(Correlation).ipynb)/ (Random Forest: https://github.com/Note06/DataScience-Proj/blob/main/Feature%20Importance(Random%20Forrest).ipynb)/ (Neural Network: https://github.com/Note06/DataScience-Proj/blob/main/Feature%20Importance(NeuralNetwork).ipynb)


## Problem Statement: 
With so many different factors that can affect water quality, which ones have the most impact?
We decide to use the idea of feature importance. By identifying data that impacts the decision the most we can increase our data accuracy prediction and improve efficiency.
